# Help Yourself! Building a Network Info Agent with GenAI and MCP

In my role as a Distinguished Engineer in the Network Operations Center (NOC) at Cisco Live Europe, I encountered a constant need for a self-service interface to streamline workflows. NOC engineers often needed to quickly locate devices, reserve DHCP leases, or better understand network operations. My first attempt at solving this problem involved building a chatbot for Webex. While it worked, the solution quickly devolved into a muddle of regular expressions that made it difficult to effectively parse IP addresses, MAC addresses, and usernames. In 2025, with the explosion of generative AI capabilities and the GPUs we deployed for Cisco Live Amsterdam, I saw an opportunity to reinvent this tool. Leveraging GenAI on top of Ollama and incorporating tools for custom context injection, I developed a state-of-the-art "Information Broker." A few months later, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) entered the scene. Now, its AI-powered agent integrates with network operations systems and uses MCP to intelligently manage context, ensuring more relevant and accurate responses in complex environments. In this session, I'll walk you through:

* Setting up your own Ollama instance as the foundation for a GenAI-powered tool.
* Developing an MCP server to enhance your agent's ability to handle dynamic interactions with multiple tools and context switching.
* Developing an AI-powered information agent that integrates with NetOps systems to provide actionable network insights while maintaining operational security.
